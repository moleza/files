# Create Application User Script
#
# Description:
# This script creates a new system user intended for running applications.
# It will interactively ask if the user should be granted permissions to
# manage Docker containers.
#
# The user will have a disabled password to prevent direct login and can be
# accessed via 'sudo su - <username>'.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Save this script as 'create_app_user.sh'.
#   2. Make it executable: chmod +x create_app_user.sh
#   3. Run with sudo and follow the prompts:
#      sudo ./create_app_user.sh
#
# ==============================================================================

# --- Pre-flight Checks ---

# Check if the script is being run as root.

# --- Interactive Setup ---

# --- Main Execution ---

echo "Starting setup for user: $USERNAME"

# --create-home: Creates a home directory for the user (/home/apprunner).

    exit 1
fi
echo "   ...User created successfully."


# Step 2: Lock the password for the new user.
# The -l flag locks the user's password, making it impossible to log in
# with a password. This is more secure than just assigning an empty password.
echo "-> Disabling password-based login for '$USERNAME'..."
passwd -l "$USERNAME" >/dev/null
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
    echo "Error: Failed to lock the password for '$USERNAME'." >&2
    # Clean up by deleting the user if password lock fails.
    userdel -r "$USERNAME"
    exit 1
fi
echo "   ...Password locked successfully."


# Step 3: (Optional) Add the user to the 'docker' group.
if [[ "$SETUP_DOCKER" = true ]]; then
    # This grants the user the necessary permissions to interact with the
    # Docker daemon (e.g., run 'docker ps', 'docker build', 'docker-compose').
    # The -a (append) and -G (groups) flags add the user to the supplementary group.
    echo "-> Adding '$USERNAME' to the 'docker' group..."
    usermod -aG docker "$USERNAME"
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        echo "Error: Failed to add '$USERNAME' to the 'docker' group." >&2
        exit 1
